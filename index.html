          <h2>Never Stop Developing</h2>

          <p>I wear many hats, and will wear many more. Perhaps I'll borrow yours for a bit. But the unifying trend is that I like to build. I get my hands on a project and I want to see it done well, efficiently, cleanly, so that it will endure. Good results, least waste. "It's all in the details" is a cliche, a throw-away line. The details matter immensely, but it's easy to get lost in them. The scope of a project matters, too. The big picture. What do you want? How will you get there? Where can you compromise, and where must you hold the line? Who's responsible for what, how long will it take, and how much will it cost?</p>
          <p>I write books, cook dinner, design websites, scheme databases, help customers get choose eyewear and lens options that suit their needs and desires, wrangle tons of orders through production, shipping and claims processes, design training and write out process workflows for my department, communicate with coworkers all the way up to the top of the command chain when I see things that I think should be done better (and how), or be better recognized, and I tackle some hefty ideas with Lego, just to push the limits of audacity. To see what I can pull off, that is. All projects, all following the same process, and I love it.</p>
          <p>I find great joy in starting a new project. I charge in, hashing out big ideas. Then perhaps some frustration sets un, the feelings of being unequal to the task, or uncertain of where I'm going. That's the sign for me to step back, examine what I've splashed out thus far, and start organizing it. I ask the questions above. What's the purpose or audience of this thing? What do I need to achieve, how much effort should I use to get there? I create a structure, a map that will lead me to my destination within the alloted fuel budget, passing the right scenery, and then — map assembled — the rubber hits the road.</p>
          <p>Well, that vastly extended metaphor is a bit misleading. My car is <em>not</em> fast. It's a vomit-beige 2001 Echo. The rubber is always on the road. No action-movie hill-jumps.</p>
          <p>Then again, I wasn't writing about my real car, was I? I was talking about how I handle project conceptualization, organization, and process management, and I'd <i>Tokyo Drift</i>ed (there's a movie with an epically bad tag line) into a driving metaphor. So the car is my... brain? In that case, my car's a DeLorean Transformer Radmobile.</p>
          <p>Not shy.</p>

            <img src="images/BREAK_thumb.jpg" alt="A book cover: a luminous gas giant of whirled blue-green clouds fills the night sky. In the low foreground, black silhouettes of five heroes.">
            <p>Writing is my first love as far as big projects go, and <i>BREAK!</i> was my first self-published book. I had a ton of fun (and frustration, joy, and furious creative fugue) pulling this story out of my head. Concieve, begin, take stock, design, plan, edit and edit and edit, then evaluate and draft and edit again. And then I had more fun with layout, artwork, cover design, and pushing the whole thing out to multiple publishing platforms. Cut my self-publishing teeth on this one.Complicated processes, but so rewarding. Fun with GIMP, too: the planet in the sky is made out of broken glass and a picture of lettuce.</p>

            <p>My second self-published novel, and an even better process. My scope and vision for the novel was better-controlled. The story was shorter, faster, and I knew where I was going every step of the way. I expanded my GIMP skills getting the cover right, and got through the self-publishing designa and distribution process much more easily than I did when working on <i>BREAK!</i>. (Yes, all caps and the excalamation point are part of the title.)</p>

            <h3>CogNode</h3>
            <img src="images/CogNode card.png" alt="A demonstration of the CogNode font. Glyphs are formed of heavy gear-like segments connected with delicate nodes, like schematics of circuits.">
            <p>Going back to <i>BREAK!</i>, I wanted a particular look to the title treatment on the book. I started to just try to draw the letters the way I wanted, but within a few minutes I determined that this would be dumb. Wouldn't it be easier if there were a font that looked how I wanted it to? So I looked into it, and learned how to make a font. CogNode was the result, and gave me not only an easy way to handle the title on the cover, but the inner treatment, and will provide consistency of design for future works.</p>
            <p><span id = "snippet">Here's an example of CogNode in action. CAPS HAVE THE HEAVY, HEFTY COG-THINGIES; lowers are just made of nodes and lines. Definitely a decorative, Fantasy/SteamPunk/MagiTek kinda font.</span> Not something to subject readers to for very long, like I did right there.</p>

I worked with Executive board members to negotiate a major restructuring of our department, which involved bringing highly opinionated partner/doctors onto the same page and a shared vision of the growth of our practice.
