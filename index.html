        <h2>Never Stop Developing</h2>

        <p>I wear many hats, and will wear many more. Perhaps I'll borrow yours for a bit. But the unifying trend is that I like to build. I get my hands on a project and I want to see it done well, efficiently, cleanly, so that it will endure. Good results, least waste. "It's all in the details" is a cliche, a throw-away line. The details matter immensely, but it's easy to get lost in them. The scope of a project matters, too. The big picture. What do you want? How will you get there? Where can you compromise, and where must you hold the line? Who's responsible for what, how long will it take, and how much will it cost?</p>
        <p>I write books, cook dinner, design websites, scheme databases, help customers get choose eyewear and lens options that suit their needs and desires, wrangle tons of orders through production, shipping and claims processes, design training and write out process workflows for my department, communicate with coworkers all the way up to the top of the command chain when I see things that I think should be done better (and how), or be better recognized, and I tackle some hefty ideas with Lego, just to push the limits of audacity. To see what I can pull off, that is. All projects, all following the same process, and I love it.</p>
        <p>I find great joy in starting a new project. I charge in, hashing out big ideas. Then perhaps some frustration sets un, the feelings of being unequal to the task, or uncertain of where I'm going. That's the sign for me to step back, examine what I've splashed out thus far, and start organizing it. I ask the questions above. What's the purpose or audience of this thing? What do I need to achieve, how much effort should I use to get there? I create a structure, a map that will lead me to my destination within the alloted fuel budget, passing the right scenery, and then — map assembled — the rubber hits the road.</p>
        <p>Well, that vastly extended metaphor is a bit misleading. My car is <em>not</em> fast. It's a vomit-beige 2001 Echo. The rubber is always on the road. No action-movie hill-jumps.</p>
        <p>Then again, I wasn't writing about my real car, was I? I was talking about how I handle project conceptualization, organization, and process management, and I'd <i>Tokyo Drift</i>ed (there's a movie with an epically bad tag line) into a driving metaphor. So the car is my... brain? In that case, my car's a DeLorean Transformer Radmobile.</p>
        <p>Not shy.</p>

          <h3>Skipping Stone</h3>
          <img src="project-thumbnail.png" alt="description of image">
          <p>The first big coding project I gave myself, progressing from my passion for speculative fiction writing. It's a choose your own adventure story. That's where the coding really comes in, in the construction of a working, interactive website that changes with the choices the reader makes.</p>
          <p>Still under construction as of 08/10/2020.</p>

            <h3>Books!</h3>
            <img src="project-thumbnail.png" alt="description of image">
            <p>Writing is my first love as far as big projects go. I had a ton of fun (and frustration, joy, and furious creative fugue) pulling these stories out of my head. Concieve, begin, take stock, design, plan, edit and edit and edit, then evaluate and draft and edit again. And then I had more fun with layout, artwork, cover design, and pushing the whole thing out to multiple publishing platforms. Complicated processes, but so rewarding.</p>
